Euler's Totient Function:
    1. It is used to count the number of positive integers up to a given integer n that are co-prime with n
    2. Euler's totient function is a multiplicative function, meaning that if two numbers p and q are relatively prime, then:
        f(pq) = f(p)*f(q)
        if k numbers are pairwise relatively prime, then:
            f(p[1]p[2]...p[k]) = f(p[1])*f(p[2])*...*f(p[k])   
    3. When n is prime number, according to the definition of prime, f(n) = n-1
    4. If p and q are different prime numbers, because p and q are relatively prime, we have:
        f(pq) = f(p)*f(q) = (p-1)*(q-1)

Euler's Theorem:
    - If p and q are relatively prime, then:
        pow(p, f(q), n) = 1
    where f(q) is Euler's totient function.
