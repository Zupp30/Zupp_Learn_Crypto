RSA - The cryptosystem:
    0. Example:
        - Secret Text: 2
        - Sender:
            + Encryption: (5, 14)           (e, n)
            + Ciphertext: pow(2, 5, 14) = 4
        - Receiver (d is kept only by him):
            + Decryption: (11, 14)          (d, n)
            + Text: pow(4, 11, 14) = 2

    --> How do we find the way to encrypt and decrypt?
    
    1. Choose two large prime numbers p and q (randomly and secretly)
    2. Compute n = p*q 
        - n is used as the modulus and is published
    3. Compute f(n) = LCM(p-1, q-1) or (p-1)*(q-1)
        - LCM(a, b) = (a*b)/GCD(a, b)
        - f(n) is kept secret
    4. Choose an integer e such that 2<e<f(n) and GCD(e, f(n)) = 1 that is e and f(n) are co-prime
        - The most commonly chosen value for e is 65537
        - The smallest and fastest possible value for e is 3
        - e is published
    5. Determine d such that d*e â‰¡ 1 (mod f(n)) that is f(n)*u + 1 = e*d
        - We can calculated d using Extended GCD's code:
            a*u + b*v = GCD(a, b)
            that is f(n)*u - e*d = GCD(f(n), e) = 1
            {
                r1, r2 = f(n), e
                add = e
                s1, s2, t1, t2 = 1, 0, 0, 1
                while r2:
                    q, r = r1//r2, r1%r2
                    s, t = s1 - q*s2, t1 - q*t2
                    r1,r2, s1,s2, t1,t2 = r2,r, s2,s, t2,t
                d = s1
                while d<0: d += add
                print(d)
            }

            or using Python's library:
            {
                from Crypto.Util.number import inverse
                print(inverse(f(n), e))
            }

            or using pow:
            {  
                print(pow(e, -1, f(n)))
            }
    6. NOTE that:
        - Public key: n, e
        - Private key: d, p, q, f(n)
    
    7. Explanation for the Example above:
        p = 2
        q = 7
        n = p*q = 14
        f(n) = LCM(p-1, q-1) = 6
        e = 5 as 1<e<f(n) and e is co-prime with f(n)
        d = pow(e, -1, f(n)) = pow(5, -1, 6) = 5 + 6*k for k is random
        Choose d = 11
